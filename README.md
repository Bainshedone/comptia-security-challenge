| Governance, Risk, and Compliance     | 14%                       |

## Challenge
🚀 It's not a challenge in the traditional sense, but a personal challenge to learn most of the topics within a month.

## Why do this on GitHub?
🌍 Putting things in public makes me accountable for my actions, which in turn will act as a motivating factor.
